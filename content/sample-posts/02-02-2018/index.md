As we have [covered before](http://soggy-ink.surge.sh/Day-19), with ES6 we can write modular code. This refers to the way we structure our work and link file/components together, a way we can split up our code onto multiple files.

The idea behind imports & exports statements which make up the modular structure/modules, is that inside a javascript file we can import content from another file, so that the javascript files themselves know their dependencies.

There are different ways and syntax used to import and export files, depending on how much of the file you need to import or export. These are called `named exports` and `default exports`.

# default export vs named export

![import and export example](https://scontent.fsyd5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/28684923_10159985011370117_1205131256988266696_n.jpg?oh=3b905de49024cb1e73faa0408a8ceb80&oe=5B0CCFF2)

Say we have a person.js file and also a utility.js file and we need to use all or part of both in a third file called app.js

Here are two ways in which to export/import files. On the left we have person.js which will export the `person` component
