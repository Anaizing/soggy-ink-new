# Awesome React Resources

Here goes a list of great stuff by smart React lovn people...

1. Pretty much anything by [Cory House](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight. Learning React, wether you're a beginner or intermediate, this guy has something for you. Amazing teacher, very clear and thorough, my favorite thing about his courses is they incorporate testing and he gives you a good idea of a real world working environment.

2. [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/)- this is an active online community of over 20000 React developers. It includes facebook developers and a long list of open source contributors.<br>
They also host one or two Q&Aâ€™s per month with Facebook Engineers and other interesting developers in the React community... check it out!

3. There is a huge amount of free and mature component libraries online. In case you dont want to build all your components.
    * [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) open sourced their component library
    * [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) offers a set of React components that implement google's material design guidelines
    * [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is a popular library that contains react components that make it easy to work with bootstrap
    * and there is a massive sweet sweet list on [github](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) full of standalone components you might want to work with.

4. Thanks to the love react has received from devs, there are many mature projects to fit your every need. Granted you should shop around and be well informed before starting any project, this just scratches the surface of the ecosystem...

    * For Routing- React Router
    * to handle complex data flows- Redux || Mobx
    * set up automated testing- Jest (also from facebook)
    * alternative to RESTful API calls, where you can declare your API calls on the client- GraphQL
    * to quickly set up a server side rendered site with node- Next.js

5. A curated [list of links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) by Mark Erikson <br>
_"Curated tutorial and resource links I've collected on React, Redux, ES6, and more, meant to be a collection of high-quality articles and resources for someone who wants to learn about the React-Redux ecosystem, as well as a source for quality information on advanced topics and techniques."_

That should be enough of a rabbit hole for now... ENJOY!!
