Welcome to my blog, so glad you could make it.
This is my official first ever blog post, so its bound to be slightly horrifying for you (my apologies)

I guess I should start by introducing myself, my name is ANAI ARAYA, spelled with an I at the end, for invincible, not an L for looser. I was born in Chile, needless to say my parents speak Spanish, so little did they know my name at a quick glance would look like anal to the untrained eye. Alas, I persevered through this great struggle, seeing as it wasn't really a struggle, I mean there are worse things in life, like actually living in a third world country.

However I am proud to call Australia home, I've lived here for 20years, and aside from a mild adoration with Japan and its culture, Australia is my favorite country, so I'll probably die here too, fingers crossed.

So I like to call myself a freelance web developer but I'm really more of a latecomer to this huge web dev world trying to catch up one failure at a time, and that's pretty much what this blog will be about.  As well as my many failures, I will be making a daily report on what I'm learning, with a focus on Javascript, React, Node.js, CSS Grid and how not to throw your laptop onto oncoming traffic in a fit of rage... Just kidding, I cant tell you how to deal with your own demons, that's your problem.

This blog is really more for me than it is for you, but if you get something out of it even better!! So if you see something you like, tweet away. That's probably enough about me for now, hopefully I haven't bored you to death and if I have, too bad.

On to the good stuff... I created this blog fairly quickly (couple of hours) following this great [article on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481)
Built using React, Node.js (although I had some troubles with npm, so I used yarn instead) & Gatsby which uses GraphQL to fetch data.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a blazing fast static site generator based on ReactJS. A static site generator (SSG) is a compromise between a hard-coded HTML static site and a full blown CMS (Content Management System), like Wordpress. A SSG can be used to generate HTML pages for content-driven websites (such as blogs). All it requires is data for page content and the template to fill with content. Gatsby utilizes GraphQL to fetch data from one or many sources such as your local disk, Wordpress API, and so on.

Its a pretty sweet way to get up and going fairly quickly, and once installed you'll be able to write each blog post in markdown, just like you would on github. If you're not familiar with markdown [here's a really good & quick tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/). Out of the box its pretty ugly, but thats where you come in with your mad skills to give it a bit of sex appeal. If you're feeling a bit more adventurous and want to get a bit more out of learning react, I also found [this other great React tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/creating-a-blogging-app-using-react--cms-1171) on how to build a blog app. This is more in depth and uses React, Node.js and MongoDB on the back end & Express, looks great and I'll let you know when I give it a go. But for my purposes the Gatsby one was quick and easy.

So I've been teaching myself web development since the start of June last year, so I have about 8 months of sporadic resources of information, and if you're interested you can find them [on my github](https://github.com/Anaizing/Studying-and-learning).

I think thats it for my first ever blog post, if you're still reading, high fucking five my friend.

If you need anything come find me...

See ya
