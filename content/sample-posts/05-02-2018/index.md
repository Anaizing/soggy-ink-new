It's generally a good practice to minify and combine your assets (Javascript & CSS) when deploying to production. This process reduces the size of your assets and dramatically improves your website's load time.

Source maps create a map from these compressed asset files back to the source files.

This source map allows you to debug and view the source code of your compressed assets, as if you were actually working with the original CSS and Javascript source code.

Using webpack there are a variety of ways to implement source-maps that work at different speeds, and can be selected depending on what you need for your project.

Have a good one`!!`
